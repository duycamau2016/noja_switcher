# Changelog

## 1.4.1

### Added

- **Security badges in the tree views.** The CVE warnings from 1.4.0 (previously
  only in the webview panel) now also appear in the **Versions** and **Install
  New** tree views: a `⚠️ <severity> · N CVE` tag on affected Node versions,
  a red icon, and the CVE ids in the hover tooltip.
- **Confirmation before pinning** a Node version with known advisories from the
  tree view (clicking a flagged version), matching the panel's switch warning.

## 1.4.0

### Added

- **Security advisory scanning.** Installed and available Node versions are
  checked against the official [Node.js Security WG database](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/tree/main/vuln),
  and any version with known CVEs gets a red ⚠️ badge (hover for the CVE ids,
  severity and summary). The database is fetched from GitHub and cached under
  `~/.nodevm/vuln-cache.json`, refreshed at most once every 24h, so scans are
  offline-friendly and never block the UI.
- **Warning before switching to a vulnerable version.** Using a Node version with
  known advisories raises a native confirmation modal first (highest severity +
  the CVE ids). Cancelling leaves the active version unchanged.
- **Security audit** — a *Scan installed versions* button in the Settings tab
  reports how many installed Node versions are affected, with the worst severity
  per version. Node-only; JDK is unaffected.

## 1.3.0 — unreleased

### Added

- **nvm installs are listed.** Node versions under an nvm root show up in the
  Versions view, the panel and the pin picker, badged `nvm`, and can be pinned
  to a workspace. The root is resolved from `NVM_HOME` or the `root:` line of
  `settings.txt` on Windows, and `$NVM_DIR` (default `~/.nvm`) elsewhere.
  Strictly read-only — nothing is installed into or removed from an nvm root,
  and Uninstall stays disabled for those rows. Enumeration reads directory
  names, so it costs no subprocess. fnm, Volta and asdf are not read.
- The row nvm itself currently has selected is marked `nvm current`. The
  `NVM_SYMLINK` target is confirmed to be a real symlink first, so a plain Node
  MSI install at the same path is not mislabelled as nvm-managed.

### Changed

- Workspace pins now record the install directory alongside the version. The
  same version string can name both a managed install and an nvm one, and
  resolving by version alone would hand back the managed copy even when the nvm
  row was the one clicked. Pins written before this stay valid — a bare version
  string still resolves, and a recorded path that has since disappeared falls
  back to matching by version.
- Pin resolution reads the new `listLocal()` (managed tree plus nvm roots,
  `readdirSync` only) before falling back to the full `listInstalled()`, so
  pinning an nvm version does not put `where node` back on the activation path.

## 1.1.0 — unreleased

### Added

- **Per-workspace version pinning.** Each VS Code window resolves its own Node
  and JDK version, so two repos open side by side no longer fight over one
  machine-wide link. Pins are stored in workspace state and applied through the
  window's terminal environment; the shared `~/.nodevm/current` junction is left
  alone.
- **Version files.** A `.nvmrc`, `.node-version` or `.java-version` in the
  workspace root pins the repo for everyone who clones it. A pin set in the UI
  overrides the file. Disable with `nodeversions.useVersionFiles`.
- `NodeVersions: Pin Node Version to Workspace`,
  `NodeVersions: Pin JDK Version to Workspace` and
  `NodeVersions: Unpin Workspace (Use Global Defaults)`.
- `NodeVersions: Set Global Default Node/JDK Version` — the old machine-wide
  switch, now explicit and behind a confirmation.
- The status bar distinguishes a pinned version (`$(pin)`) from the global
  default, and warns when a pin names a version that is not installed.
- After a version change the extension offers to relaunch terminals that are
  already open, instead of leaving them silently on the old version. Relaunching
  stops what is running in them, so it asks first; `always` / `never` are
  available through `nodeversions.relaunchTerminalsOnChange`.

### Fixed

- **Node was never added to the terminal `PATH`.** An extension gets a single
  mutator per environment variable, so `prepend('PATH', …)` for Node followed by
  `prepend('PATH', …)` for the JDK silently discarded the Node one — only the
  JDK bin was ever prepended. Both directories now go in as one prepend.
- A pin had no effect in the integrated terminal once the **Settings** tab's
  shell-startup hook was installed: the PowerShell profile / `~/.zshrc` prepends
  the global `current` link *after* the terminal environment is built, so
  `node -v` kept reporting the global version. The environment changes are now
  also applied through terminal shell integration, which runs after the profile.
  When shell integration is disabled the extension says so instead of silently
  losing.
- One failed command registration no longer aborts the rest of activation. With
  two copies of this extension installed under different publisher ids
  (`duycamau2016.nodeversions` and `yudaliot.nodeversions`) the second copy hit
  `command already exists` mid-registration, leaving tree items pointing at
  commands that were never registered. The conflict is now reported by name.

### Changed

- Clicking a version in the **Versions** view now pins it to the workspace
  instead of switching the machine-wide default. The global switch moved to the
  right-click menu (**Set as Global Default**).
- `NodeVersions: Switch Node/JDK Version` were renamed to `Pin … to Workspace`
  and now pin rather than switch globally. The command ids are unchanged.
- The webview panel's "use this version" pins to the workspace too, so the
  panel, the tree view and the status bar always agree.
- A pin that names a version which is not installed no longer falls back to the
  global default — the fallback was the cross-repo bleed this release fixes.

## 1.0.0 — unreleased

First VS Code release. Ports the Node & JDK Version Manager desktop app into the
editor, reusing its version-management engine unchanged.

### Added

- **Panel** (`NodeVersions: Open Panel`) — the full desktop UI in a webview:
  installed versions, install new, listening ports, settings.
- **Terminal integration** — the active Node/JDK is prepended to `PATH`
  (and `JAVA_HOME` set) for **newly opened** integrated terminals. Toggle with
  `nodeversions.autoUpdateTerminalEnv`.
- **Status bar** — shows the active Node and JDK version; click to open the
  panel. Toggle with `nodeversions.showStatusBar`.
- **Commands** — `Switch Node Version`, `Switch JDK Version` and
  `List Listening Ports` run as Quick Picks without opening the panel.
- Long installs report to VS Code's notification progress area.

### Changed from the desktop app

- The self-update UI is removed; the Marketplace handles extension updates.
- Machine-wide `PATH` / `JAVA_HOME` edits now require an explicit confirmation
  dialog.
